**If you failed to connect to my server use a vpn!**


If you want to use a local server make sure to change the current ip in the retrofit config java file to your ip,

also in php config file use proper username and password for accessing the database.

**Future development suggestions**
* make a new app for hotel managers ;)

* app + server:
   - [ ] mvvm architecture
   - [ ] ability to remove reservations
   - [ ] moving pictures to server and using glide to load them
   - [ ] sms verification for registration
   - [ ] ability to remove favs
   - [ ] new design ofc
   - [ ] getting in and out dates first and then showing available rooms in those dates! (requires huge changes in php files)
   - [ ] getting number of hotels in each city from server
   - [ ] saving hotel and user data locally
   - [ ] using saved favs local data to show faved hotels in a city's hotel list
   - [ ] show location of hotels on map
   - [ ] user profile
   - [ ] add all strings to strings.xml and add other languages
   - [ ] in comment section show if the user has made a reservation in the hotel
   - [ ] sorting, rating and reporting comments
   - [ ] adding a back button for all activities, and only showing navigation drawer in the city activity
   - [ ] settings
   - [ ] search

* security:
   - [ ] using a proper php framework
   - [ ] give a token for verifying user requests
   - [ ] give a random reservation code
